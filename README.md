## SpotifyAPI
I created a web app that uses the Spotify API to first authenticate the site using an API Key, connect to an exisiting device, then give the user the ability to adjust playback features. These features include selecting and playing a song, volume adjustment for desktops, and a skip/play button.

Futher documentation and photos will be posted here later.
